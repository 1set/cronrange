/*
Package cronrange parses Cron-style time range expressions.

In a nutshell, CronRange expression is a combination of Cron expression and time duration to represent periodic
time ranges.

For example, every New Year's Day in Tokyo can be written as:

	DR=1440; TZ=Asia/Tokyo; 0 0 1 1 *

It consists of three parts separated by a semicolon:

    - `DR=1440` stands for duration in minutes, 60 \* 24 = 1440 min;
    - `TZ=Asia/Tokyo` is optional and for time zone using name in IANA Time Zone database (https://www.iana.org/time-zones);
    - `0 0 1 1 *` is a cron expression representing the beginning moment of the time range.
